OPENAI_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI KEY GOES HERE>
Steps
Clone this repo!
Copy over your documentation to api/sources
Run docker-compose: docker-compose up
You should now have two endpoints running:

The Nextjs-based frontend: Open http://localhost:3000 to meet Bricky.
The Haystack-based API: Open http://localhost:8080/docs with your browser to see the OpenAPI documentation.
Note: if you make changes to the any files, i.e. api/.env or the docs in sources/docs, you need to rebuild the images: docker-compose rebuild --no-cache.
